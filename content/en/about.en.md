# Welcome to stefshine's playground

Hello dear visitor, my name is St√©phane TANKOUA. I'm a software engineer keen on programming, especially functional programming.
I'm a scala fluent (I think) programmer, a haskell wannabe.

On this blog I will share with you some interesting thoughts I've been througth during my journey of learning functional programming and type systems.

Come and say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stefshine) where I sometimes express some thoughts.
You can see some of the ugly things I do on my [Github page](https://github.com/stankoua).

See you soon :wave:.
