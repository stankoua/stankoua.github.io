# Hello Word Post

Here is a simple Hello Word app in `Scala`:

```scala
object Main extends App {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println("Hello World")
}
```

And in `Haskell`:

```haskell
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

It was tough, isn't it ? That's all for the joke, we will see more interesting things in the next posts.
